# Classification-Problem
🚀 Just completed an exciting Python project to sharpen my skills in classification and hypothesis estimation! The main objective was to revisit and refine my Python programming while diving deep into classification concepts.

Here's a quick rundown of the project's key steps:

1️⃣ Hypothesis Estimation (S and G): I automated the process of estimating hypotheses S and G for a given set of training data points. No hardcoding needed! The hypotheses adapt seamlessly to different datasets.

2️⃣ Generating Test Data: To evaluate the hypotheses, I generated a test dataset with similar ranges and random coordinates. This ensured robust testing across various scenarios.

3️⃣ Testing Hypotheses on Test Data: Finally, I applied the estimated S and G hypotheses to the test data, computing percentages for:

Positive points falling within S.
Negative points falling within S.
Positive points falling within G.
Negative points falling within G.
The result? An adaptable codebase that streamlines efficient classification and analysis, making it versatile for handling a wide range of datasets. 📊💻
